This is a multithreaded puzzle solver in which I implement thread pools to improve the speed.

Build & Run:
- libraries
- `cd` into the repo
- `make`
- `./puzzleSolver`
- Answer the command-line prompts. The general flow is `create [num_pieces] [piece colours] continue Y [numthreads] [batch_size] [num_solutions]`, and you can use `help` to see other commands
