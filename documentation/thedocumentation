explain how to fix the problem with piece names/symbols not being unique

explain how to add pieces to the piece list

explain what to do when piece_names has a key that doesn't match the name of the piece it maps to (main.cpp, stage 0)

explain what to do when some of the pieces share a symbol.

basically update this to explain all the things that messages.cpp promises it'll explain.

NOTE: There's an edge case during 'make'.
    I use the -MMD flag to generate dependency files (.d)
    If a .o file is compiled without -MMD, and then the -MMD flag is added to the Makefile 
        and the header dependencies for that .o file are removed from the Makefile (bc they're not needed thanks to -MMD), 
        then 'make' won't detect any changes when the necessary headers are modified, and thus will not trigger a rebuild
            when it normally would.
        - this is because the .d files haven't been generated yet, and the header dependencies were removed from the Makefile,
        so the Makefile doesn't know that header modifications are relevant to the .o file.

    TLDR if you change the makefile, run make clean. There are ways that take less time to compile but this is the easiest way.
